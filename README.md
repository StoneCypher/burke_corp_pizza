## The what now?

Inevitably, at some time in your life, you will attempt to Google how much of some or another topping, most often cheese, to put on the pizza you're about to make.  It is part of the human condition.  You may hate pizza, and be allergic to every ingredient; you will still do this, at least twice.  Accept your fate.

Once you do, you will be confronted with a range of opinions 3x wide.

Eventually, you'll come to some or another pizza-specific forum.  They, in turn, will point to an older version of a pizza proportioning guide given by a vendor of, amongst other things, pizza toppings, called The Burke Corporation.  We defer to an older version because [the contemporary version](https://www.burkecorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Portion-Guide.pdf) has sadly been simplified; older versions have "low medium high" columns, whereas the contemporary only has "medium," and has removed the guides for half-pan and full-pan rectangular pizzas (weirdly, just as they're becoming popular, under the name "Detroit style.")

This dataset is pulled from [the 2011 edition](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/37985/docs/pizzatoppingportionguide_2011.pdf), instead.  None of the retained numbers were changed.

## Why this one?

So, look.  There's actually a good reason that pizza recommendations are so different.  It turns out, by example, that CostCo uses about double the per-inch cheese that Domino's does.

And you know what?  Those produce very different results, and they cook differently, and different people like different things.

My opinion is that the Burke Corporation numbers produce a "stereotypical American pizza."  That is, not a New York or a Chicago pizza, but rather the kind of pizza that you'll get in a better generic pizza shop in any random city in the country.  I find this to be an acceptable norm.  I will, subsequently, look for similar datasets for "style" pizzas - New York style, Chicago style, Neapolitan, &amp;c.

This guide provides amounts for 

* Sauce
* Cheese
* 25 toppings, two (pepperoni and mushrooms) each in two different forms

Annoyingly, it does not give dough guidance.

## Save me some time - put it here

A lot of people are just looking for numbers, and the code is a waste of their time, so, the numbers are also in this document.

Burke vends meats, has good ingredients, and is geared for small restaurants.  You've probably eaten a lot of their food.  [If you're making a pizza shop, look them up](https://www.burkecorp.com/fully-cooked-meats/).
